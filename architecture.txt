3- If you're deploying a Kubernetes cluster with an AWS Load Balancer Controller, you can annotate an Ingress resource to use an HTTPS listener by specifying the ACM certificate ARN.
 - Route 53 helps direct user requests to your Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) securely and efficiently:
   It maps your custom domain name (e.g., www.example.com) to the ELB DNS name.
   When combined with an ELB HTTPS listener, Route 53 ensures users are seamlessly connected to your application over a secure connection
